`MSnbase` is an R/Bioconductor package that provides infrastructure for plotting, data manipulation and processing of MS-based proteomics data. The official page is the Bioconductor landing page ([release](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MSnbase.html) or [devel](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/MSnbase.html) versions). The [github page](https://github.com/lgatto/MSnbase) page is for sharing, testing, issue tracking and forking/pulling purposes. Although it should be in sync with the code on the [Bioconductor svn server](https://hedgehog.fhcrc.org/bioconductor/trunk/madman/Rpacks/), the latter is the official repository for the working source code.
